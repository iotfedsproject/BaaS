BaaS (Blockchain as a Service) is an application built with hyperledger fabric and JavaScript. It is developed building on the "asset-tranfer-basic" tutorial provided in the [Fabric documentation](https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/latest). The network implements smart contracts capable of managing organizations and federations formed by them. Those smart contracts are exposed through a RESTful API. Finally, on the client side, an application that can serve for voting purposes within federations was developed.
